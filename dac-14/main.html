<H2>Abstract</H2>

Behavioral synthesis entails application of a sequence of
transformations to compile a high-level description of a
hardware design (e.g., in C/C++/SystemC) into a
register-transfer level (RTL) implementation.  In this
paper, we present a scalable equivalence checking framework
to validate the correctness of compiler transformations
employed by behavioral synthesis front-end.  Our approach
makes use of dual-rail symbolic simulation of the input and
output of a transformation, together with identification and
inductive verification of their loop structures.  We have
evaluated our framework on transformations applied by an
open source behavioral synthesis tool to designs from the
CHStone benchmark.  Our tool can automatically validate more
than 75 percent of the total of 1008 compiler
transformations applied, taking an average time of 1.5
seconds per transformation.
