<H2>Abstract</H2>

We present a deductive method for proving invariants of reactive systems. Our
approach uses term rewriting to reduce invariant proofs to reachability
analysis on a finite graph. This substantially automates invariant proofs by
obviating the need to define inductive invariants while still benefitting from
the expressiveness of deductive methods. We implement a procedure supporting
this approach which interfaces with the ACL2 theorem prover. The interface
affords sound extension of our procedure with rewrite rules based on proven
theorems. We demonstrate the method in the verification of cache coherence
protocols.
