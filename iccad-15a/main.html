<H2>Abstract</H2>

Restoration Ratio (SRR) has been the de facto standard for
evaluating quality of signals selected for post-silicon
tracing and debug.  Given a set <i><b>S</b></i> of selected
signals, SRR measures the fraction of (gate-level) design
states that can be inferred from observing signals in
<i><b>S</b></i> at each cycle.  Unfortunately, in spite of
its widespread use, we found that SRR is intrinsically
unsuitable as a metric for evaluating trace signal quality,
as it captures neither the higher-level functionality of the
design nor the constraints and requirements on trace signals
imposed by architectural, physical, or security
requirements.  In this paper, we argue with strong empirical
evidence that SRR must be replaced by a metric that closely
models high-level behavioral coverage.  We propose assertion
coverage as a first step in this direction.  We also present
a new algorithm, based on Pagerank, for post-silicon trace
selection.  Pagerank is <i>not</i> designed to maximize SRR.
We found that Pagerank has upto 70% higher behavioral
coverage than SRR optimizing methods, and the RTL PageRank
has upto 30% higher behavioral coverage than the netlist
PageRank algorithm.  Assertion coverage of PageRank RTL is
upto 50% while SRR based methods have less than 5%
assertion coverage.
