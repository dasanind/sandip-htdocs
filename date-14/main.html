<H2>Abstract</H2>

Function pipelining is a key transformation in behavioral
synthesis.  However, synthesizing the complex pipeline logic
is an error-prone process.  Sequential equivalence checking
(SEC) support is highly desired to provide confidence in the
correctness of synthesized pipelines.  However, SEC for
function pipelining is challenging due to the significant
difference between the behavioral specification and
synthesized RTL.  Furthermore, function pipelines include
hardware logic for dynamically inserting ``bubbles''
(pipeline stalls), which bring additional difficulties in
equivalence checking.  We develop an SEC framework for
behaviorally synthesized function pipelines by (1) building
a reference pipeline model with a certified function
pipelining transformation, which faithfully captures bubble
insertion; and (2) checking the equivalence between the
reference model and synthesized RTL.  We demonstrate the
scalability of our approach on industry-strength designs
synthesized by a commercial tool.
