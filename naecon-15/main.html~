<H2>Abstract</H2>

Behavioral synthesis involves generating hardware design via
compilation of its Electronic System Level (ESL) description
to an RTL implementation.  Equivalence checking is critical
to ensure that the synthesized RTL conforms to its ESL
specification.  Such equivalence checking must effectively
handle design and implementation optimizations.  We identify
two key optimizations that complicate equivalence checking
for behavioral synthesis: (1) operation gating, and (2)
global variables.  We develop a sequential equivalence
checking (SEC) framework to compare ESL designs with RTL in
the presence of these optimizations.  Our approach can
handle designs with more than 32K LoC RTL synthesized from
practical ESL designs.  Furthermore, our evaluation found a
bug in a commercial tool, underlining both the importance of
SEC and the effectiveness of our approach.
