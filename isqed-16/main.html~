<H2>Abstract</H2>

We consider the problem of reconstructing system-level
behavior of an SoC design from a partially observed signal
trace.  Solving this problem is a critical activity in
post-silicon validation, and currently depends primarily on
human creativity and insights.  In this paper, we provide an
algorithm to automatically infer system-level transactions
from incomplete, ambiguous, and noisy trace data.  We
demonstrate the approach on a multicore virtual platoform
developed within the GEM5 environment.
