<H2>Abstract</H2>

We present a method to abstract, formalize, and verify industrial
flash memory implementations.  Flash memories contain specialized
transistors, <i>e.g.</i>, floating gate and split gate devices, which
preclude the use of traditional switch-level abstractions for their
verification.  We circumvent this problem through behavioral
abstractions, which allow formalization of the behaviors of the design
as interacting state machines.  Behavioral abstractions are agnostic
to transistor type, making them suitable for formalizing flash
memories.  We have verified industrial flash memory implementations
based on both floating gate and split gate technologies.  Our work
provides the first formal functional verification results for
industrial flash memories.
