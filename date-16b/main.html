<H2>Abstract</H2>

A major challenge in post-silicon debug is to generate
efficient tests that activate requisite coverage goals on
the target hardware while also producing results that are
observable through a given on-chip design-for-debug (DfD)
architecture.  Unfortunately, such tests cannot be generated
by analysis of RTL models, both because of design complexity
and since the implementation can be buggy.  In this paper,
we propose an approach to address this problem by exploiting
transaction-level models (TLM).  Our approach involves
mapping test and observability requirements between TLM and
RTL, enabling TLM analysis to generate post-silicon
tests. We provide case studies to demonstrate the
flexibility and effectiveness of the approach.
