<H2>Abstract</H2>

We propose to write a thesis on using theorem proving with algorithmic
techniques for verification of large scale computer systems. Large-scale
computer systems tend to have a non-terminating computation, and reasoning
about such systems involves exhibiting some temporal property of the
system. For large system models, automatic verification of non-trivial temporal
properties is often infeasible, because of the state explosion problem. Theorem
proving has a better potential to scale up to large designs, but it often
requires considerable user assistance to guide the proof. We consider an
intermediate approach, using theorem proving to verify correspondence between
executions of a concrete system design and its abstraction, and then using
automated analysis to verify the temporal properties of abstractions. We
explore the logical issues and problems involved in the use of automated
analysis on abstractions verified by a theorem prover. We propose to implement
tools and techniques that provide a reasonable amount of automation in the
verification process. Further, we plan to demonstrate our techniques on
verification of multiprocessor system models, and specifically focus on
synchronization protocols, cache coherence, and pipelined architecture of
realistic systems. We use ACL2 (a programming language, logic, and theorem
prover) to illustrate our techniques.
