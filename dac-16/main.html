<H2>Abstract</H2>

Systematic implementation of System-on-Chip (SoC) security
policies typically involves smart wrappers extracting local
security critical events of interest from Intellectual
Property (IP) blocks, together with a control engine that
communicates with the wrappers to analyze the events for
policy adherence.  However, developing customized wrappers
at each IP for security requirements may incur significant
overhead in area and hardware resources.  In this paper, we
address this problem by exploiting the extensive
design-for-debug (DfD) instrumentation already available
on-chip.  In addition to reduction in the overall hardware
overhead, the approach also adds flexibility to the security
architecture itself, <i>e.g.</i>, permitting use of
on-field DfD instrumentation, survivability and control
hooks to patch security policy implementation in response to
bugs and attacks found at post-silicon or changing security
requirements on-field.  We show how to design scalable
interface between security and debug architectures that
provides the benefits of flexibility to security policy
implementation without interfering with existing debug and
survivability use cases and at minimal additional cost in
energy and design complexity.
