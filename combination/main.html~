<H2>Abstract</H2>

This article presents a procedure for proving invariants of
infinite-state reactive systems using a combination of two formal
verification techniques: theorem proving and model checking.  This
method uses term rewriting on the definition of the target system to
reduce an invariant proof of the target system to a reachability
analysis on a finite predicate abstraction, which can be discharged
through model checking.  The method affords substantial automation in
invariant proofs, while preserving the expressiveness and control
afforded by theorem proving.  We discuss how their approach enables
the two disparate techniques, theorem proving and model checking, to
complement one another.  The procedure has been interfaced with the
ACL2 theorem prover, and we describe its use in verifying cache
coherence protocols in ACL2.
