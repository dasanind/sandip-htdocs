<H2>Abstract</H2>

Behavioral synthesis involves compiling an Electronic
System-Level (ESL) design into its Register-Transfer Level
(RTL) implementation.  Loop pipelining is one of the most
critical and complex transformations employed in behavioral
synthesis. Certifying the loop pipelining algorithm is
challenging because there is a huge semantic gap between the
input sequential design and the output pipelined
implementation making it infeasible to verify their
equivalence with automated sequential equivalence checking
techniques. We discuss our ongoing effort using ACL2 to
certify loop pipelining transformation.  The completion of
the proof is work in progress.  However, some of the
insights developed so far may already be of value to the
ACL2 community.  In particular, we discuss the key invariant
we formalized, which is very different from that used in
most pipeline proofs.  We discuss the needs for this
invariant, its formalization in ACL2, and our envisioned
proof using the invariant.  We also discuss some trade-offs,
challenges, and insights developed in course of the project.
