<H2>Abstract</H2>

We consider the conflicts between requirements from security
and post-silicon validation in SoC designs.  Post-silicon
validation requires hardware instrumentations to provide
observability and controllability during on-field execution;
this in turn makes the system prone to security
vulnerabilities, resulting in potentially subtle security
exploits.  Mitigating such threats while ensuring that the
system is amenable to post-silicon validation is
challenging, involving close collaboration among security,
validation, testing, and computer architecture teams.  We examine
the state of the practice in this area, the trade-offs and
compromises made, and their limitations.  We also discuss an
emerging approach that we are contemplating to address this
problem.
