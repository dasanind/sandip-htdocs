<H2>Abstract</H2>

Modern SoC designs contain a large number of sensitive
assets that must be protected from unauthorized access.
Authentication mechanisms controlling access to such assets
are governed by a large number of complex <i>security
policies</i>.  The policies affect multiple design blocks,
and may involve subtle interactions between hardware,
firmware, and software.  The design of security policies is
a complex process, requiring comprehension of the interplay
between security and functionality requirements across
multiple IPs in the SoC over the life-time of the system
execution.  The implementation of such policies, often
referred uniformly as a <i>security architecture</i>,
typically involves a combination of hardware and firmware
modules distributed across the different IPs of the system.
This paper gives an overview of the design of SoC security
architectures, emphasizing on the distributed codesigns
between various components that are necessary both in
specification and implementation of these policies.  The
complexity induced by these codesign requirements is itself
a source of errors and security vulnerabilities, and we
discuss research needs in the area for developing robust,
trustworthy SoC designs.
