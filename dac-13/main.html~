<H2>Abstract</H2>

Loop pipelining is a critical transformation in behavioral synthesis.
It is crucial to producing hardware designs with acceptable latency
and throughput.  However, it is a complex transformation involving
aggressive scheduling strategies for high throughput and careful
control generation to eliminate hazards.  We present an equivalence
checking approach for certifying synthesized hardware designs in the
presence of pipelining transformations.  Our approach works by (1)
constructing a provably correct pipeline reference model from
sequential specification, and (2) applying sequential equivalence
checking between this reference model and synthesized RTL.  We
demonstrate the scalability of our approach on several synthesized
designs from a commercial synthesis tool.
