<H2>Abstract</H2>

A key problem in post-silicon validation is to identify a
small set of traceable signals that are effective for debug
during silicon execution.  Most signal selection techniques
rely on a metric based on circuit structure.
Simulation-based signal selection is promising but
have major drawbacks in computation overhead and restoration
quality.  In this paper, we propose an efficient
simulation-based signal selection technique to address these
bottlenecks.  Our approach uses (1) bounded mock simulations
to determine state restoration effectiveness, and (2) an
ILP-based algorithm for refining selected signals over
different simulation runs.  Experimental results demonstrate
that our algorithm can provide significantly better
restoration ratio (up to 515%, 51% on average) compared to
the state-of-the-art techniques.
