<H2>Abstract</H2>

A key problem in post-silicon validation is to identify a
small set of traceable signals that are effective for debug
during silicon execution.  Traditional signal selection
techniques structural analysis of the circuit typically have
poor restoration quality; simulation-based selection
techniques provide superior restorability but incur
significant computation overhead.  In this paper, we propose
an efficient signal selection technique using machine
learning to take advantage of simulation-based signal
selection while significantly reducing the simulation
overhead.  Our approach uses (1) bounded mock simulations to
generate training vectors set for the machine learning
technique, and (2) an elimination approach to identify the
most profitable signals set.  Experimental results indicate
that our approach can provide speed-up of up to 60X in
selection time (16X on average) and can improve
restorability by up to 66.9% (14.1% on average).
