<H2>Abstract</H2>

We present a framework for formal verification of embedded custom memories.
Memory verification is complicated by the difficulty in abstracting design
parameters induced by the inherently analog nature of transistor-level designs.
We develop behavioral formal models that specify a memory as a system of
interacting state machines, and relate such models with an abstract read/write
view of the memory via refinements.  The operating constraints on the
individual state machines can be validated by readily available data from
analog simulations.  The framework handles both static RAM (SRAM) and flash
memories, and we show initial results demonstrating its applicability.
