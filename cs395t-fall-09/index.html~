<h2>Course Outline</h2>

This course is about industrial application of formal verification.
Formal verification is the use of mathematical methods to ensure that
computing systems behave safely and securely.  Formal verification now
a crucial component of the validation tool flow for many system design
components, such as circuit designs, communication and security
protocols, device drivers, etc.  In this course we will learn
verification problems facing the industry today, the current tools and
techniques available to address them, and the strengths and weaknesses
of those techniques.  The course will focus on research challenges in
developing robust, scalable formal verification techniques.

<h2>Textbook</h2>

There is no textbook.  We will point to papers pertaining to various
topics discussed in the class.  Handouts may be distributed for some
of the materials.

<H2>Grading</H2>

The grades will be based on:
<ul>
<li> Class Participation (20%)</li>
<li> Paper Presentation (20%) </li>
<li> In-class Final (20%)</li>
<li> Project (40%)</li>
</ul>

<H2>Class Participation</H2>

This is a seminar course.  You are expected to participate actively in
the class discussion.  We will keep a record of your class responses.  

<H2>Homeworks</H2>

Sometimes problem sets will be assigned as homeworks.  The homeworks
will not be graded; instead, we will discuss the homework in class on
the day it is due.  Your comments and responses during the discussion
will count towards your class participation grade.

<H2>Paper Presentation</H2>

Students will present papers (both classic and recent) discussing
different verification techniques and application domains.  Student
presentations will be limited to one hour.  We will provide a list of
papers based on the different topics of interest.  You are free to
choose your own papers, but if you do, please talk to the instructors
before-hand.  When someone presents a paper, the others are expected
to ask questions and provide comments if something is unclear.  At the
class after the presentation, each student other than the presenter is
expected to submit a short summary containing both a review of the
material presented and a critique of the presentation itself.  Your
presentation grades will be based on quality of your own presentation,
as well as the quality of your remarks and review.

<H2>Project</H2>

We will discuss different project topics as the semester progresses.
If there is some topic that you want to pursue, please come and talk
to the instructors about it.  Projects may be done individually or in
groups.  More detailed guidelines on projects will be given later.

<h2>Class Schedule</h2>

A tentative schedule is available <a href="schedule.html">here</a>.
The schedule may be adjusted to suite the interest of the class.

<h2>Scholastic Dishonesty</h2>

All submitted work (in reports and tests) must be your own, with the
exception of group work in projects and any other collaboration
explicitly permitted by the instructors.  Scholastic dishonesty will
not be tolerated and will be referred to the Dean of Students Office.

for a summary of expectations from a CS student.  If you are unsure
whether some act will constitute scholastic dishonesty please feel
free to contact the instructors or University officials for
clarification.
