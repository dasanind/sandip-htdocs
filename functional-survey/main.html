<H2>Abstract</H2>

The increasing size and complexity of industry hardware designs, along
with stringent time-to-market requirements, have put a heavy burden on
verification to ensure that designs are relatively bug free. A general
theme successfully adopted by academia and several vendors is to apply
multiple verification techniques so that they complement one another,
resulting in an increase of the verification tool's overall
effectiveness. Such integration must be carried out delicately and
precisely so that the overall technique becomes more than merely a sum
of the techniques. This article surveys the research that has taken
place in this area.
